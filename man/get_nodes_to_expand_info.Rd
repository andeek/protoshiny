\usage{
get_nodes_to_expand_info(hc, dc)
}
\arguments{
\item{hc}{hclust object}

\item{dc}{a vector of length n with integers between 0 and num_clusters such as
is outputted by dynamicTreeCut::cutreeDynamicTree}
}
\value{
Returns an n-vector giving the labels of each interior node. A positive value
    means that all nodes in that node's subtree have that label.  A value of -1 means
    that this node's children have different labels.  A value of -2 means that at least
    one child has a value of -1.  And so forth.
