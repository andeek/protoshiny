\title{Given a clustering get the root-to-node paths for expanded nodes}
\usage{
get_paths_from_cut(hc, cl)
}
\arguments{
\item{hc}{An object of class `hclust`}

\item{cl}{A numeric vector in the format of the output of `stats::cutree` 
that gives the cluster memberships of each leaf.}
}
\description{
This function returns the binary path from root to node for each interior 
node that needs to be open to return the input clustering.  Note that this 
will only be possible for a clustering `cl` in which each cluster corresponds
to a branch of `hc`.
